Win32API::MIDI version 0.05
=======================

Win32API::MIDI - Perl extension for MS Windows 32bit MIDI API

   Win32API::MIDI is a Perl extension for MS Windows 32bit MIDI API.
   It supports almost all MS Windoews 32bit MIDI API, MIDI output,
   input, and stream API.

   This module is still under development.  API may be changed to
   improve usability.

INSTALLATION

   To install this module type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

DEPENDENCIES

   This module is being developed on Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/)
   environment.  It is not tested well on Active Perl environment,
   since I don't have MS C Compiler.  I had a report saying it could
   be compiled and MIDI output worked well but MIDI input did not.
   Any feedback from ActiveState Perl users' are welcome.

   On Cygwin Devel/gcc, Libs/w32api package are required in addition
   to Base package.
